- [Hard water does it cause hair loss](https://youtu.be/XVZXVkHpiA0)

Because anytime that I don't wash my hair follicles feel dry even after a deep conditioner and moisturizing session on wash day and I am learning that some hard water can lead to my hair strands opening which is already bad because this explains my hair _still_ being dry and my hair is already extra fine stranded high porosity hair. 

I noticed when I went to another person's house and rinsed my hair there my hair was soft, bounced, and my twist outs were so defined that I wash shocked _and_ shook! 

I heard awhile ago about some dangers for washing with hard water and I tested the water at my apartment with pH sticks and it wasn't that bad but apparently my hair _feels_ otherwise and my son's skin with eczema also flares up less to none with soft water.

## Use purified water bottles to wash hair if I can't purchase a faucet filter or filter replacement 


But if I ever run out of finances for the filter changes every 6 months or whenever I can always use the filtered water that I like to drink anyway until I purchase a filter, like [essence water](https://www.amazon.com/Essence-Alkaline-Water-Liter-bottles/dp/B00QVQS35G/ref=sxts_rp_s_a_sp_1_0?content-id=amzn1.sym.8947a61d-f8de-4667-bf86-26743c3affd1%3Aamzn1.sym.8947a61d-f8de-4667-bf86-26743c3affd1&crid=MCTGM4NIJIK1&cv_ct_cx=essence+water&keywords=essence+water&pd_rd_i=B00QVQS35G&pd_rd_r=015b31a5-439d-4b95-ad40-743c6fb314ab&pd_rd_w=vKzEl&pd_rd_wg=EypCb&pf_rd_p=8947a61d-f8de-4667-bf86-26743c3affd1&pf_rd_r=NFKK5AXY6V9CCW2J6G6T&qid=1686550425&sprefix=essencd+wate%2Caps%2C160&sr=1-1-3a65484d-1c95-4bed-b564-9469fdeef107) or just the diluted water gallons from Walmart would do to rinse my hair.

I can also use it with Aloe Vera Juice for my daily hair spritz, because [[Hair/My Hair Loves Aloe Vera juice\|My Hair Loves Aloe Vera juice]]!!!
