# My Hair is more manageable with soft-purified water
***

 I noticed that water and the condition of water matters a lot to my hair type or any hair type and good ph water. Washing or rinsing my hair at home afterward my hair strands feel dry and feel like I have to instantly add conditioner, but after going over to someone elseâ€™s house and using _their_ water I forgot my hair products but my hair was: 

- soft the entire day _and_ the next day
- manageable (after being in twists) and WITHOUT my usage of regular hair oils and conditioners 

and that was when I noticed I donâ€™t need these things as much as I thought I did. That I actually had really good and soft hair when I did soft water. 

So I started to think if I canâ€™t afford a shower filter I need to wash my hair under a big bowl or the sink with a water bottle water with a good ph, preferably ph 10. 
If I can drink good water,  it so should my hair. 

I just need to have the right water that is not hard water that may give off high deposits of iron, calcium, and lead and God knows what else is going into my hair...
