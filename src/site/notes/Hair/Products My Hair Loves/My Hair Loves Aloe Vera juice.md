# My Hair Loves Aloe Vera juice
---

My hair loves aloe vera juice and aloe vera gel from the leaf plant but if I can't find the plant, since that is only seasonal, than regular aloe Vera juice/gel that I could buy at the store works good too and works as a great slip when detangling my hair, while keeping it moisturized as a daily moisturizer.

The Aloe Vera juice can be used as a daily spritz for my hair or a refresher spritz for my fro throughout the day due to my hair's high porosity and is especially beneficial for dry climates or the summer.
