# About Nexus Notes

## What is Nexus Notes

If you have not realized by the title of this site or if you have come across this site from my others you may have realized that…

I like to take notes…and write…_ALOT_, 

maybe too much…if that’s even a thing…

But either way Nexus Notes is a place where there are interconnected notes or “posts” that are intertwined through links and backlinks. So basically this is my personal Wiki of my notes of interests and learnings that have accumulated over the years. 

I think of this place as a way for me to see: 

- Notes that I find valuable that I have taken on different interests and hobbies of mine (as I am growing in these areas), but don’t know where to put them to get back to them quickly when I need them

- Notes that I need to trace back again or refer to a lot but don’t have a set place to find them despite trying so many note-taking/writing apps, and analog systems 

- Any updates on things that I either _have_studied or are currently researching, studying, or trying to understand in my free time cuz’ I like to read too

- Any systems and methods that I have come across or developed on my own that would be pertaining to my current workflows or systems. By notating these areas I could see what worked and didn’t work for me. (similar to having a changelog or devlog) 

_AND THEN THERE’S THE FACT THAT I NEED TO CLEAN OUT BOTH ANALOG AND DIGITAL NOTES …_

Posting helps me to quickly filter all of this information that I need quickly. When I need to find something through using the search bar, I can quickly get back to whatever I need, anywhere at anytime as long as I have the internet. (_and even then the original notes would be archived offline somewhere-because I’m paranoid like that)_ 

This is helpful for me to not have to waste time, like I have been, trying to organize my notes _or_waste time trying to find what I need by sifting through scattered pieces of paper notes all over my house in different notebooks and folders…And do not get me started on the _ungodly_ amount of time I have spent trying different theories and methodologies for trying to organize my digital notes. 

There are times where…

- I would have tried an app, stopped using it, or did not like it and the problem would come from not remembering _why_. Was it because it did not fit my way of thinking? Was it because I was using it for the wrong purposes? I want to remember so that I don’t deal with issues that I dealt with in the past but just forgot about and so I would end up bringing those said issues back up in my present…done that _before_. 
- I worked on a project, paused it, or just started researching and brainstorming on a project that I did not start but wanted to in the future. In the cases where I did not remember _why_ I started what I did or where those resources were I ended up _wasting_ more time trying to start back from square one if I did decide to work on that idea. 

So writing these things down is to help me to remember by just making a quick note about what I would like to get back to in the future, instead of trying to keep things in my head or across my desk. And this also makes me form a habit of posting and writing daily while cleaning up the junkyard of notes all at the same time! 

Because these notes are for me they are not really going to be written in a communicative style and some of them _may_ not make sense to you. I _definitely_ am not going to spend much time on revisioning them as I do on my main blogs. I don’t plan on spending too much time on this site. That’s not the intention and I’m _all_ about intentionality. 

So while I am clearing up and cleaning out things if I come across something that I notated about that I believe I need in the future I place it here and if not I get rid of it. I’m trying to keep from having a stash of knowledge in the form of notes, notebooks, and sticky notes all throughout my house when I want to limit my paper usage and be more _intentional_ about what I _do_ keep a record of…because it _has_ gotten out of hand…literally. 

And of course, if you _are_ interested in the same things that I am, I figured that publishing these set of notes (_outside_ of [my field notes](http://fieldnotes.kwenelatubbs.com/)) could be a beneficial resource for you. So why not? Sharing is caring. I come across and _continue_ to come across a lot of things that has helped me out over the years and that has improved my quality of life in many ways so, why not help you?

## Want to talk about it? 

Unlike my other [ministry video streaming sites](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCKHACaOJ-F0W4OgCyrJaEWg)and social media platforms that I am on I don’t really plan on turning on the comments sections to _this_ site. This is because it’s my personal notebook. _However_, if you _do_ have a question about something or want to give me a shout you could do so on my [twitter](https://twitter.com/realKwenelaT). I’m not _too_ active on there but I do check messages or tweets from time to time.
