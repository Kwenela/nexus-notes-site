# Outliners options to use as my Dedicated Note-Taker 

---

_Just as I thought was going to happen when I set out on reviewing all the different type of outliner apps that I am already familiar with and have used before, I settled on using Remnote_


> [!NOTE] On using Obsidian outliner 
> I can still use the zoom and the outliner plug-in for having the same type of outliner functionalities within obsidian but I do not want to rely on it because it is still not the same as using a dedicated outliner. 
> I also have to remember not to rely on plug-ins for my main drivers of my workflows, and just use plug-ins for enhancing my workflows as mentioned in: [[` Home/Inbox/`Organize/Plug ins should enhance my writing experience in apps not to be relied on\|Plug ins should enhance my writing experience in apps not to be relied on]]

# Quick reminder of experience with outliner apps

Since you are familiar with Roam is it more reliable then Logseq with data loss. I really love Logseq but have to leave it now and currently using Remnote as a replacement but itâ€™s great but still is off somehow. 

Didnâ€™t like Athens Research because I canâ€™t export from an .index file I know nothing of. 

Workflowy is great but not for what I need it for and Dynalist would be perfect if the Backlinks were not native to the app only. 

Tana is a no go for me; no mobile app similar to the desktop and Iâ€™m not trying to build systems anymore

Hypernotes is actually the closest fit 
But at this point I finally donâ€™t mind paying for an app thatâ€™s high in quality to complete my writing workflow. 

I paid for a month of Mem.Ai and saw it overkill to pay for an app that you have to pay more for Ai requests WITH premium when I could have just stayed in obsidian to have that for free. Mem is the same price as Roam. 





## Different Outliner apps options 


1. Remnote 
	- Pros 
		- All devices 
		- Reliable sync 
		- Never lost files 
		- Clean UI 
		- More visual and easy navigation 
		- Plug-ins that are actually helpful 
		- Donâ€™t need but built in easy spaced repetition cards by using >> sign to quickly make cards (great for studying verses and scripture) _this is great and better than using obsidian plug-ins that do this because I donâ€™t want to rely on plug-ins_
		- Can contact support team through chat 
		- Designed for students so l think there is less likely an opportunity for sync issues and being offline 
		- Option to have notes locally stored 
		- Reliable Mobile app (so far) on iPhone and iPad 
		- Free plan 
		- Can embed video to take notes 
		- Graph view option (paid)
		- works well off-line
	- Cons 
		- Exporting out doesnâ€™t render wikilinks on export 
			- (_this is okay when exporting individual note sessions over to obsidian because in obsidian there are link mentioned that would be able to auto connect the notes for me as well as using the chat gpt plugin that finds closely related notes for me to link_)
		- No Canvas ðŸ˜¢ðŸ˜”
2. Craft 
	- Pros 
		- The most beautiful UI out of every notetaking up I have ever tried in my life
		- smooth like butter in her face in the writing experience is amazing
		- Off-line functionality so I can store my notes in iCloud drive and donâ€™t have to store my notes craft cloud
		- export is great to all formats just like every app on this list
	- Cons
		- I CAN GET LOST USING THIS APP ONLY BECAUSE OF THE TEMPTATION TO MAKE THE DOCUMENTS LOOK PRETTY OVER WRITING
		- when exporting export is only going to export craft only links 
3. Logseq 
	- Pros 
		- All devices 
		- Simple UI (I like it reminds me of a notepad)
		- Donâ€™t need but built in easy spaced repetition cards by using _this is great and better than using obsidian plug-ins that do this because I donâ€™t want to rely on plug-ins_
		- Option to have notes locally stored 
		- Free 
		- Can embed video to take notes 
		- Graph view option (free)
		- Canvas!!!
		- Open sourced (good for really private notes if I make any)
	- Cons 
		- UNReliable Mobile app (so far) on iPhone and iPad but I think itâ€™s because of iCloud Drive which gives issues with syncing with apps like [[Issues I had with Ulysses syncing\|Issues I had with Ulysses syncing]] 
		- Not reliable sync (current logseq sync is still in beta and I have lost notes from syncing through iPad to Mac and while in one sitting)
		- Lost files before on multiple occasions 
		- Plug-ins are helpful but not to be relied on because some are unstable and itâ€™s not in the core features of apps like I would prefer 
4. Athens Research 
	- ==This is great for if I just need a quick outliner that is offline, but I do not think I should use this because: 
		- ==1. Can not export to Markdown==
		- ==2. Community is not as active which is an issue if I need help and for some reason can not go to discord invite from their site after many tries== 
	- Pros 
		- Beautiful just like Logseq or Roam and wouldnâ€™t have to learn anything new 
		- Graph view 
		- Works offline 
		- Active community 
		- Open sourced (good for really private notes if I make any)
	- Cons 
		- Havenâ€™t used it enough since itâ€™s initial release to give a good assessment 
		- Canâ€™t find where local database of notes is stored on desktop (link for how to access the data bases here: [Athens Handbook](https://handbook.athensresearch.org/community/athens-guide/feature-list/database-selection) but after playing with the app I found it was in my documents folder as a index. file)
		- Desktop only 
5. Roam Research 
	- Pros 
		- Basically would be like working in Logseq or Athens Research 
	- Cons 
		- $15 a month is way too expensive for what I will be using as a side, secondary app and not as a primary app
		- I still canâ€™t get over the fact that there are better free open sourced alternatives to use instead of this app
		- A little worried that some people have worried about if development has gone to a paused, or at least stopped
		- Some people have complained about losing data and thatâ€™s already an issue if the app is proprietary so I donâ€™t wanna take that risk
		- Proprietary app
		- for a while it seems more like a cult or cultish many other people have said the same thing as far as the community goes, but that has nothing to do with the app itself in my opinion
6. Dynalist
	- Pros
		- All devices 
		- Reliable sync 
		- Never lost files 
		- Clean UI 
		- Same developers of Obsidian 
		- More visual and easy navigation 
		- Designed more for daily notes or personal notes 
		- Reliable Mobile app (so far) on iPhone and iPad 
		- Free plan 
	- Cons 
		- developers are more focused on developing obsidian more than dynalist even though dynalist is not abandoned
		- The community is not as active as obsidian or other app communities if I ever need help
		- Export wikilinks and Backlinks are dynalist specific and donâ€™t convert to [[ \| ]]
7. Workflowy 
	- Pro 
		- Reliable sync 
		- Never lost files 
		- Clean UI and smooth like butter!!!
		- More visual and easy navigation 
		- Can contact support team through email  
		- Reliable Mobile app on iPhone and iPad 
		- Free plan 
		- Can embed video to take notes 
		- Kanban boards I love 
		- Daily free backup by email reminders on what changes were made (changelogs) paid option backups to Dropbox daily (_this is good even if notes are not stored locally_)
		- Longevity over other outliners and reliability 
		- Can link and Backlink 
		- Everything in one page which is easy to search for things 
		- Excellent search 
	- Cons 
		- No Option to have notes locally stored 
		- No Graph view option 
		- Export eliminates wikilinks made in document 
		- Online access only 
		- Have had a few issues when workflowy was down and couldnâ€™t access my notes wasnâ€™t down too long and they keep you informed when it happens but this still can break my workflow when writing to where I wouldnâ€™t have this issue had I been locally working on notes
8. Tana 
	- Pros 
		- it is so beautiful
		- This app tickles my fancy to tinker with systems when I wanna be able systems and be able to view everything that I have
	- Cons 
		- The learning curve is higher than me, and Iâ€™m not in the mood to try to learn another app right after spending time, learning obsidian and Logseq.
9. Hypernotes 
	- Pros 
		- outliner that looks beautiful and more reliable than Logseq 
		- Works off-line
		- Graph view and every time you click a node the note opens up on the side, very similar to how hepta base does which I like and I think I can use the same ability in obsidian when I click a graph if I were to pin in the graph while having the sliding tab feature on
		- Free with two notebooks
		- Beautiful special view of all the documents in a notebook before clicking into a document
		- constantly upgrading
		- Excellent exporting
		- good backlinking features
	- Cons 
		- Proprietary app
		- Not aware of any communities behind the app but thatâ€™s not the troubling 
		- Can you see anything else wrong with this as I have not really tried this app but if any of the major absent Iâ€™m using is an outliner stopped working this will be a great alternative to jump on
		- ==It says that you can embed any kind of content or media but when I try to embed a YouTube video to take notes on it on the mobile app, it did not pull up an embed iframe and instead just clicked over into the video on YouTube is not the purpose that I want to use that function for==
