# wikiblogging
***

Wikiblogging is a term that I came up with because I realized that I donâ€™t normally just write *one* blog post and then publish it; but that while I am writing one post or essay, I am also writing multiple ones that are interlinking together like a wiki that interlinks and backlinks different topics or concepts.

But since I am blogging and multiple topics emerge to  where I am blogging multiple things at the same time in batches, then I figured that I could just call this style of writing or blogging wikiblogging where my blog post naturally are scheduled and posted as interlinking wiki blogs initially instead of coming back later to try to find and connect related posts links. 

Wikiblogging also keeps me from going on wide tangents when Iâ€™m trying to talk about a topic which I typically tend to do when I am writing, so when I see that Iâ€™m going on a different path I can continue writing but just:

1. cut the new section of text that will be a new blog post
2. paste it under a new topic link as a related post to the current active blog post (that the emerge blog post came out of)

So when a blog post will be posted, it will be heavily linked to other blog posts on initial posting.

*After reading other peoples blogs, I realize that the topic of wikiblogging is something that has already been out since itâ€™s kind of interesting, but I also noticed that everybody uses this term differently.*
