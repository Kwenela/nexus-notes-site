# Deep stretch-workout before going into deep work 

Doing deep stretches before going into deep work is an excellent combination, especially since I am sitting for prolonged periods. 

I'm trying to find ways to implement a consistent but non-exhaustive workout regimen since I'm sitting more than I'm comfortable with since I animate, video edit, and write a lot; all of which takes up anywhere between 3â€“10 hours of combined focus times when I'm deeply focused. 

It's hard for me to get up when I zone out and focus on what I have in front of me, but in doing this even if [[Productivity/GTD/I get certain things done\|I get certain things done]] I'm still neglecting my health, which isn't good. I would forget to work out and stretch because it has not been prioritized for me like how [[I need to prioritize and appreciate sleep over work\|I need to prioritize and appreciate sleep over work]] which makes me more efficient mentally when I do.

**Benefits of me being able to sneak a quick stretch or workout in-between deep work sessions** 

1. My brain and my body are relaxed instead of tensed which is the perfect prep for deep work which results from body and mind tension
2. I can get up in between breaks and still be able to work out or do stretches to keep my muscles and body limber 
3. I can keep my metabolism high and still burn calories while being still if I make a habit of stretching and doing mini-intense workouts in between my deep work sessions. I can burn calories instead of collecting and hibernating calories. 
4. Will force me to get my butt up 
5. Could help me with being tired at the end of the day and wanting to stop working or find a stopping point to [[repose\|repose]] 
6. Won't be dealing with the constant headaches and sciatica/nerve issues that I have from my military injury. I never had to deal with the same amount of pain as I do now when I was more active in the gym or running but lost the activity after childbirth. Need to pick that back up. 
7. Can keep my mind fresh since it would be less tense after a workout or stretch session and ideas would be less constrained combined with my renewed blood flow. 
8. I can be more energized to get back to work versus feeling sluggish and exhausted from the last workout session trying to go back into another session feeling lethargic.

It's easier for me to be consistent with this when I'm watching someone else work out. So I need to have videos saved and ready to watch. I've noticed it's easier because I'm not thinking or trying to convince myself not to do something when it's time to work out, but instead just follow someone else to tell me what to do which also relaxes my mind. Less decision-making and just doing.
