# Favorite Workout Channels

**I'm enjoying watching these workout and stretching channels over the years. Also, need to remember that it's best to have a certain group of channels on rotation to not make another personal gatekeeper for myself to keep me from working out or stretching by looking for videos to watch. Need to catalog them here to not fall for distractions when opening YouTube when I need to work out: **

1. [AllBlancTv](https://youtube.com/@AllblancTV) 
2. [Tom Merrick](https://youtube.com/@BodyweightWarrior)
3. [Mady Morrison](https://youtube.com/@madymorrison)
4. [Toni Mitchell](https://youtube.com/@ToniMitchell)
5. [Mad Fit](https://youtube.com/@MadFit)
6. [Strength side](https://youtube.com/@Strengthside)
7. [Fitness Blender](https://youtube.com/@fitnessblender)
8. [Get Fit with Rick](https://youtube.com/@RickBhullarFitness)
9. ðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸðŸŒŸ[Jump Rope Dudes](https://youtube.com/@JumpRopeDudes) - if I ever make excuses there is no excuse to not jump for a few minutes.
