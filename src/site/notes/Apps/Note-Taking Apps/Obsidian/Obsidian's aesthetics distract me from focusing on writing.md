# Obsidian's aesthetics distract me from focusing on writing
---

It doesn't matter how many times I have switched themes and made my own theme while playing with some CSS, it just seems like Obsidian is still off aesthetically for me to focus on my writing because I have the urge to tinker with it. 

On the mac I have downloaded other apps that can read the folders where my note files are in and occasionally edit out of them instead of editing out of Obsidian: 

- [Nota](https://nota.md/) 
- [Tangent notes](https://www.tangentnotes.com/) 
- [MarkText](https://www.marktext.cc) 
- [Paper](https://papereditor.app/?ref=mac_app_store_marketing_url)

When I quick capture an idea I can just use the Drafts app to capture and send to Obsidian through the actions list and that has been working well for me. I can't complain though because it is 10 times better than writing in google docs, microsoft word, or the text editor notepad on the desktop. 

I have not found anything as nice as Nota's UI, outside of [Typora](https://typora.io), for reading files on my mac. 

Tangent notes and MarkText works for both mac and windows so I use this when on my surface pro. 

I just use my obsidian vault as an archiving station more than my main writing or notation station. I use the bear app for that mostly. 

No amount of tweaking css and themes could justify obsidian feeling like it is visually off. It's a great app though, but I can't focus because of aesthetics and not so much the plugin community (which is also distracting). 

The Minimal Theme, Mado 11 Theme, and Things 3 Theme are the closest to elegance of me writing in Obsidian but for some reason it is still not there yet. I wonder if it is because Obsidian is an electron app?...
