# Confusion about teachers of the zettelkasten method on YouTube
---

Trying to listen to how _other_ people have adapted the Zettelkasten method has caused me so much confusion when trying to learn this method. 

Too many people are teaching or trying to teach on the zettelkasten method and a lot don't know what they are talking about. Many people are making videos on YouTube but will make a different version of an explainer video, almost explaining the same topic in a completely different way.

The enthusiasm is exciting and I love to see the passion, but this is where a lot of people, including myself, have gotten caught up in people's passions while going into confusion. In the end, time was wasted. And I ended up making my note-taking system due to the frustration of hearing different definitions called [[` Home/Inbox/`Organize/‚öôÔ∏è Systems Silos & Frameworks/Writing Workflow/i.R.E.S.T./i.R.E.S.T.\|i.R.E.S.T.]]. 

I do think a lot of people are confusing passion with understanding and so there are so many different definitions and methods of doing the same system of notetaking that it seems like all of these ways have strayed from the original Zettelkasten system that was much simpler than how a lot of people are explaining it to be. 

I think some of the videos that are claiming to explain the zettelkasten should be titled "How _I_ organize my notes" and not "*How to use the zettelkasten system*". this will save a lot of people a lot of time and heartache in the long run.
