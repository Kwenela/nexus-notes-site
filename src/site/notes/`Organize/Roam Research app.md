# Roam Research app
***
Date: 2023-07-02

## Why even consider Roam now?

After all of this time, and after even saying that I would not even consider using wrong research, I want to consider it because Iâ€™m starting to really see the value of a really good reliable note-taking app so I want to make sure that if Iâ€™m going to invest $15 a month that it will be a good investment. Because now Iâ€™m at the point where I donâ€™t mind doing that since I really do need an outline or app to add to my blogging and writing workflow. 

I was willing to pay $15 a month to use MEM.Ai and only paid for one month, but if Iâ€™m willing to do that, then I should do that with an outliner app especially since I are more easily take notes in an outliner.

**Is there a free version of Roam research?**

Honestly, there is no free version of Roam Research. But, you can use Roam Research for Free in the newly launched Roam Research Desktop App. In Roam Research Desktop app just create aÂ **Local**Â **Graph.**Â Now you can use Roam Research for free. Remember, Roam Research will not sync those notes to the cloud. [https://roamresearch.com](https://roamresearch.com/)








## Peoplesâ€™ complaints about Roam from (believers) and other avid users 

These are people who spent $500 for the believer plan and yet they still ended up leaving so I really want to see some of peoples opinions about the app and why they left and try to balance the skills to see if those will be the same reason why I may leave. 

- Data loss like logseq I donâ€™t know whatâ€™s up with these apps
- Slow
- Offline working isnâ€™t reliable to sync to current online vault

- [Why I moved from Roam to Obsidian](https://renerocks.ai/blog/why-obsidian/) - Pretty much discusses the same issues that Iâ€™m seeing other people having problems with when it comes to Roam Research.
