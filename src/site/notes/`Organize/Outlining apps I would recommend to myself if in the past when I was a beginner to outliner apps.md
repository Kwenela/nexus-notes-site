## Outliners I would never recommend to a beginner to network note-taking with an outliner

I love these apps, especially Logseq, butt would not want to have known about it had I known about the options above first or just set up systems in the options above first without having much time wasted and invested in learning [[I feel sick after losing some notes in logseq data loss issue\|logseq only to have my files deleted ]]. 



- [Roam Research.](https://roamresearch.com/) - cost when there are other options available for free that do the same offline
- [Logseq](https://logseq.com/)- be prepared for data loss even when not syncing and I am not in the mood to find what was last deleted in a backup file when more things could be deleted before I realized my current writing session was deleted. 
- [Athens Research](https://www.athensresearch.org/) - no current export to markdown or other formats
