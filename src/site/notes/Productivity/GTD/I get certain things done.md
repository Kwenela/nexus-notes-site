# I get certain things done

Getting certain things done is going to result in me being busy and that is good to an extent depending on _what_ I am busy doing. 

But just because I would get certain things done does not mean that I am getting the _right_ things done. This is something that I need to remember because:

-  [[Being busy does not mean that you are being productive\|Being busy does not mean that you are being productive]] - it just means that you are busy and moving 
- [[Being busy can make you feel self validated and affirmed into believing that you are being productive when you could just be self gratifying yourself into an abyss\|Being busy can make you feel self validated and affirmed into believing that you are being productive when you could just be self gratifying yourself into an abyss]]

Me getting certain things done or being busy just means that: 

- I am preoccupied with whatever I'm doing in the moment
- That I am focused on something at a particular time

But if I am not focused on the _right_ things at _any_ given time, then I am still _wasting_ time and wasting my life just like if I were _not_ getting things done. 

This is no different than how a lot of people could be wasting their life on different addictions. Because they too could say that they are _busy_ or “getting things done” but we can clearly see that the things that they would be getting done are not what _should_ be done or what _needs_ to be done. This comes from a [[self-imposed deception\|self-imposed deception]] that is based on fulfilling your desires and interests, which may not be important, but _would_ be important to you because those _things_ affect you and would have been prioritized by you. 

So a person that may be blinded into believing that their interests take high priority to “be getting things done”… may not realize that their mentality would be no different than an addict who would say to themselves that the object of their addiction is worth “getting things done” and both would be wasting their life as God says getting nothing done while calling nothing something. Calling being busy, productivity while prioritizing pleasures over _actual_ productivity while still saying,
